## Tasks üìù

### 0. Prime Game

Maria and Ben are engaged in a strategic game involving prime numbers. Your task is to determine the winner of each game based on the rules provided. The prototype for the function is as follows:

```python
def isWinner(x, nums):
    pass
```

**Parameters**:
- `x`: Number of rounds.
- `nums`: An array of integers representing the range for each round.

**Return**:
- Name of the player that won the most rounds.
- If the winner cannot be determined, return None.

**Constraints**:
- The range and number of rounds will not exceed 10000.
- Prohibited from importing any packages.

**Example**:

```
x = 3, nums = [4, 5, 1]
First round: 4

Maria picks 2 and removes 2, 4, leaving 1, 3
Ben picks 3 and removes 3, leaving 1
Ben wins because there are no prime numbers left for Maria to choose
Second round: 5

Maria picks 2 and removes 2, 4, leaving 1, 3, 5
Ben picks 3 and removes 3, leaving 1, 5
Maria picks 5 and removes 5, leaving 1
Maria wins because there are no prime numbers left for Ben to choose
Third round: 1

Ben wins because there are no prime numbers for Maria to choose
Result: Ben has the most wins
```

**Example Usage**:

```python
#!/usr/bin/python3

isWinner = __import__('0-prime_game').isWinner

print("Winner: {}".format(isWinner(5, [2, 5, 1, 4, 3])))
```

```
Output:
Winner: Ben
```
